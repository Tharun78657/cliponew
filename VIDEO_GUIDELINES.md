## 2. Production Workflow

### Step 1: Scripting & Concept
- **The Hook**: Grab attention in the first 3 seconds.
- **Story Arc**: Problem → Solution → Call to Action (CTA).
- **Tone**: Professional yet creative, aligning with Clipo Media's "premium glass" aesthetic.

### Step 2: Editing Best Practices
- **Pacing**: Cut on the beat of the music for dynamic energy.
- **Color Grading**: Maintain consistent color palettes. For Clipo Media, use high-contrast, clean vibrancy.
- **Sound Design**: Use high-quality background music and clean voiceovers (apply denoising).
- **Subtitles**: Always include captions for social media (80% of users watch with sound off).

### Step 3: Web Optimization
- **Compression**: Use tools like [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to reduce file size without losing quality.
- **Native Video**: When hosting on the site, keep background video files under 5MB if possible.
